**Project Overview**

In this analysis, I examined Coca-Cola’s sales performance across retailers, regions, and states, while also evaluating operating profit, monthly sales trends, top beverage brands, and delivery efficiency. The goal was to identify patterns, highlight areas for growth, and suggest data-driven recommendations to improve profitability and efficiency.

**Introduction**

Coca-Cola is a global leader in the beverage industry, operating in over 200 countries with a diverse product portfolio that includes soft drinks, bottled water, and sports drinks. Understanding its sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and optimizing business strategies.

This analysis aimed to answer key business questions, including:

1. Which retailers contribute the most to total sales?
2. How does sales performance vary by region and state?
3. What are the monthly trends in total sales and operating profit?
4. Which Coca-Cola beverage brands are the best-selling?
5. How do delivery companies compare in terms of efficiency?
